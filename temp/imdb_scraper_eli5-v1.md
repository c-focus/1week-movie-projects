Here's an **ELI5 (Explain Like I’m 5)** version of what your IMDb scraper does to **avoid detection** and **play nice with the website**:

---

## 🧠 Think of your scraper like a polite robot trying to sneak into a movie theater...

### 🔒 1. **Wearing a Disguise (Browser-Like Headers)**

The robot wears a costume that makes it look like a real person using a browser (like Chrome). This includes:

* Saying "Hi, I’m Chrome on Windows!"
* Pretending to accept cookies and webpages like a human would
  🧑‍💻 *This helps avoid getting caught as a bot.*

---

### 🔁 2. **Acting Consistently (Session Management)**

The robot doesn’t restart from scratch every time it visits a new page. Instead:

* It remembers cookies (like login info)
* It keeps using the same "browser" for multiple pages
  🍪 *Just like a person would if they kept browsing IMDb.*

---

### ⏱️ 3. **Not Rushing (Request Timing Control)**

The robot waits a bit before clicking on the next thing:

* It waits at least **half a second**
* Sometimes up to **2 seconds** randomly
  ⏳ *So it doesn’t look like it’s speed-clicking everything like a bot.*

---

### 🔁 4. **Trying Again, Slowly (Retry with Backoff)**

If a page doesn’t load:

* The robot tries again, but waits longer each time: 1s → 2s → 3s
  🧘 *Kind of like, “Oops! I’ll try again, but I’ll wait a bit to be polite.”*

---

### ⌛ 5. **Not Waiting Forever (Timeout Protection)**

If a page takes too long to load (over 10 seconds), the robot just moves on
⏱️ *So it doesn’t get stuck waiting forever for a broken page.*

---

### 🛡️ 6. **Not Crashing (Error Handling)**

If something goes wrong (bad internet, missing info, etc.):

* It keeps going
* Logs what failed for you to fix later
  🙃 *So one bad page doesn’t ruin the whole job.*

---

## ✅ Why This is Good

* 👮 Avoids being blocked by pretending to be human
* 🧘 Doesn’t overload IMDb's servers
* 🔁 Recovers from common errors automatically
* 🤖 Still works even if IMDb makes small changes
* 🚀 Ready for real use without hurting the site

---

If you're ever planning to **scale it up** or run it more frequently, consider adding **rotating proxies**, **IP reputation checks**, or even **headless browser support**. But for now, this looks like a solid, ethical implementation. 👍
