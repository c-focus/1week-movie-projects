1. As I have created a project in ChatGPT and I'm having many different conversations for different tasks inside of it I can see one issue that individual conversations don't know what we have been doing and what we want to do so is it possible to create a common document to be shared with the chats to get them all in sync. Something like this must be used by the professional developers as the work in teams, is that not it?
