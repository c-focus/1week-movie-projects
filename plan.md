### Refined Plan for Remaining 5 Days (Beginner-Friendly)

Acknowledge Your Input:

• Prioritizing IMDb scraper completion first—smart for focus; Speech AI stays deferred.
• On project motivation: Based on docs, this seems aimed at learning pro dev tools (Docker,
GitHub, docs) via a working scraper prototype. If unclear, we can pivot to clarify goals
mid-way.
• Beginner status in Docker/GitHub Actions noted—I'll simplify steps with guided, low-risk
learning (e.g., copy-paste configs, step-by-step verification).

Optimized Goals (IMDb Scraper Only - Days 1-5):

1. Day 1: Core Polish - Merge PR #6 (UI fixes). Run basic tests (pytest if setup; else
manual checks). Learn: GitHub merge process.
2. Day 2: Documentation - Update READMEs with clear setup/run steps. Add daily_log.md entry.
Learn: Markdown docs for team reference.
3. Day 3: Basic Containerization - Build simple Dockerfile (copy from template). Test
locally (docker build/run). Learn: Docker basics (images/containers).
4. Day 4: GitHub Workflow - Set up minimal GitHub Actions (lint/typecheck on push). Push
changes. Learn: Actions YAML, CI basics.
5. Day 5: Review & Buffer - Test full pipeline (run app in Docker, check GitHub). Fix issues.
Learn: Troubleshooting integration.

Extras Deferred: Speech AI, advanced features—save for post-deadline if interested.

Beginner Tips:

• Docker: Start with official Python image; no complex multi-stage yet.
• GitHub Actions: Use pre-made templates; focus on one job (e.g., run pytest).
• Learning Focus: 70% hands-on practice, 30% docs reading. If stuck, ask for clarification.
